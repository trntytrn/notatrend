  <h1>HOW TO DONATE WHEN YOU HAVE NO MONEY</h1>
  <h5>Many people have been posting videos on youtube that are filled with ads and will create a lot of revenue. 100% of the ad revenue this video makes through AdSense will be donated to the associations that support the #blacklivesmatter movement.</h5>
  <p class="stream">How to Stream:
    <br>
    <br>
    1. Do NOT put this on loop or repeat once it's done. YouTube will see it as spam and won't show you ads.
<br>
  2. Watch it through once. Then, watch 3 to 5 videos after of any length. Then, research this video manually and watch it through again. Make sure to watch different videos every time.
<br>
  3. Do NOT watch in a playlist or a browser app. Use the youtube app.
<br>
  4. Turn off ad block or youtube premium (you can make a new account or use an incognito tab)
<br>
  5. Watch on at least 480p and at at least half volume. Do NOT pause or fast forward the video.
<br>
  6. Watch through videos and do NOT skip them. You can click on ads as well!
<br>
  7. Comment and like this video - it will tell YouTube this is something people like. Be careful with your wording, though, and avoid emojis. Censor words like "stream" "views" and etc. They will categorize you as a bot.
<br>
  8. Do not clear playback or search history
<br>
  9. Share this on social media! Spread the word!
