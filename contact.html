To whom it may concern,
<br>
<br>
My name is [y/n], and I am a resident of [city/state]. I'm emailing today on behalf of the George Floyd case. I'm writing for the prosecution of Derek Chauvin #1087 and his partner Tou Thao #7162 to the fullest extent of the law and that you will not rest until that happens.
<br>
<br>
George Floyd was arrest under an implied, non-violent crime and bystanders claim that he never resisted his arrest. The approach that officers chose to take was one that resulted in murder. Therefore, it must not be taken lightly.

Black Lives Matter.

    Subject: Defund Providence Police
    <br>
    <br>
  Hello,
<br>
<br>
  My name is [name] and I am a resident of Providence. I am writing to demand that Governor Raimondo, Mayor Elorza and the members of the City Council do everything in their power to adopt a budget that redirects all funds from the Police Department and towards community wellbeing, mental health and the needs of its residents. It has become clear that police forces are ineffective at keeping local communities safe, and that they perpetuate the oppression of residents who are people of color, undocumented, mentally ill, disabled, and LGBTQ. Though Providence has received a $700,000 grant to formulate a Behavioral Health Response Team, that amount does not stack up to the nearly $90 million proposed for Police in 2021. The current budget proposal has allocated $154,450 on guns and ammunition, $1,461,620 for 50 new police recruits, and $963,626 for uniforms and "wearing apparel,” presumably including more of the officer riot gear that is currently being used to suppress peaceful protests. Imagine how much those dollars could accomplish when used to fund low-income and public housing, education, resources for formerly incarcerated individuals, and public transportation, as Direct Action for Rights and Equality has demanded.
<br>
<br>
  Providence may be a small city, but we have shown that we can make a huge impact on the United States at large. We desperately need to change our financial priorities and let our tax dollars go to communities, not cops.
<br>
<br>
  Thank you for your time,
